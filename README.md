# Nate-Personal-Portfolio
Portfolio to display my projects and be displayed on Github Pages

## Description

This is a webpage which I've setup to display my HTML/CSS skills, display my past work and give some information about me. This is done by displaying a sleek UI/UX, screenshots of past projects which link out to where they are deployed, links to my resume and LinkedIn and ways to contact me. There are several aspects of this personal portfolio which aren't perfected yet such as my resume is currently a placeholder as I'm still reworking that, and my past projects are simply placeholders since I don't have any to show off yet. This personal portfolio will continue to be updated as my skills develop over the coming months

## Usage 

My Personal Portfolio can be accessed at the following location:
